Arch 565 - Spring 2025

Hello class! This is where I will share files with you for the class, and where you can upload your journals each week. This content can also live on the server in the school, but I think it is more fun to share this way!

Jounal Submittals:
  - pdf format
  - Due Friday of the current week by end of day
  - $${\color{red}FILE\space NAMES\space MUST\space BE\space IN\space THE\space FOLLOWING\space FORMAT:}$$
```diff
Computational Journal - Frist Name Last Name - YYMMDD
```

This list is in no way exhaustive, but a short list of things I have found along the way of my own journey. I have a ton more to share and will add to the list as we go through the semester.
